A prerequisite to the development of an efficient animal health, food safety and
traceability management system in the animal food production chain is the
implementation of an integrated veterinary informational management system (VIMS)
capable for the capture, storage, analysis and retrieval of data and providing the
opportunity for the cumulative gathering of the knowledge and capability for its
competent interpretation. Such a system will enable collecting appropriate data,
including quality management and inspection controls, from all establishments and
commodities in the farm to food production chain (farms, holdings, slaughterhouses,
laboratories, traders etc.) in a structured, predefined format, and facilitate competent
analyses and reporting of such data, as well as the improvement of the existing
programs and strategies.
The role of information system in animal disease diagnosis, surveillance and
notification, control of national and international trade of commodities, food safety
management, investigation of diseases, predictive microbiology and quantitative risk
assessment is of great importance for the quality of veterinary service. Integral part of
the VIMS is animal disease notification system designed according to and in
compliance with international requirements, standards and recommendation and able
to exchange relevant information with similar information systems. The aim of this
contribution is to describe national animal disease notification system.
