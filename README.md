With the fast development of computer technology, the software projects are grow complexity. Software experts have recently sought to develop a more systematic and formal approach in the design, development and implementation of their software. This new approach has become necessary because the traditional methods of system development often yielded software characterized by late diversity, costliness, unreliability, and non-maintainability and non-use ability.
In this new age of computing everything has been computerized, so how can we become isolate and untouched from this environment. Thatâ€™s why keeping this thing in mind and an opportunity or probably a creativity to do such a task different and unique from others, we thought a way to develop this software.
This project has been developed in aim to aid and computerize Ticket booking. While keeping in mind the user will find an easy and friendlier user interface to perform his  task. The software has been made so user friendly that any person can use it easily without having any computer experience.
